# Annealing-Geom-Median
Geometric Median Location Optimizer is a Python-based optimization tool that utilizes simulated annealing to determine optimal locations based on geospatial data. This project aims to use machine learning to find the point with the least distance from all other points (Geometric Median).

# Geometric Median Location Optimizer

## Overview
**Geometric Median Location Optimizer** is a geospatial optimization tool that employs simulated annealing to compute the geometric median of a set of data points. This tool finds the optimal location that minimizes the overall distance to all points in the set, a problem without a direct arithmetic solution.

## Features
- Uses simulated annealing to determine the optimal central location.
- Computes the geometric median, representing the most central point regarding distance.
- Visualizes the optimization process for insightful data analysis.
- Offers flexible parameters for customization of the annealing process.

## Overview

### Distribution of X Values over Iterations.
As the annealer cools down, the X and Y values converge to the optima.

# Annealing-Geom-Median
Geometric Median Location Optimizer is a Python-based optimization tool that utilizes simulated annealing to determine optimal locations based on geospatial data. This project aims to find the best location by calculating the geometric median, a central tendency measure, over a range of data points.
